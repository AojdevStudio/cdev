## Command-to-SubAgent Mapping

Based on CDEV's existing command structure, here's how custom commands could be converted to sub-agents:

### Current Commands â†’ Potential Sub-Agents

| Command | Sub-Agent | Specialization |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| `/orchestrate` | `orchestrator` | Task decomposition and workflow management |
| `/agent-start`, `/agent-status`, `/agent-commit` | `agent-coordinator` | Multi-agent workflow coordination |
| `/init-protocol` | `project-initializer` | Intelligent project setup and analysis |
| `/build-roadmap` | `roadmap-architect` | Strategic planning and roadmaps |
| `/create-pr`, `/review-merge` | `pr-specialist` | Pull request lifecycle management |
| `/commit`, `/git-status` | `git-flow-manager` | Advanced git operations |
| `/generate-readme`, `/update-changelog` | `doc-curator` | Documentation maintenance |
| `/deep-search`, `/quick-search` | `deep-searcher` | Advanced codebase search |
| `/enforce-structure` | `structure-enforcer` | Project organization and standards |

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with High-Impact Agents**: Begin with `orchestrator`, `quality-guardian`, and `project-initializer`
2. **Maintain Command Compatibility**: Keep existing commands while adding sub-agent alternatives
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Convert commands to sub-agents one by one, testing each integration
4. **Tool Optimization**: Restrict tools based on each sub-agent's specific needs for better performance

### **Apps Script Development Pipeline**

**11. Apps Script Requirements Planner (`apps-script-requirements-planner`)**
```markdown
---
name: apps-script-requirements-planner
description: Google Apps Script requirements elicitation specialist. Use proactively to translate informal business workflow requests into structured technical specs for Apps Script automation.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

You gather requirements for Google Apps Script automation. When given informal requests, produce: (a) business objective, (b) data sources, (c) triggers (time-based / installable / web app), (d) success metrics, (e) security/access needs, (f) edge cases. Output a JSON spec the developer agents will implement.

Begin work immediately when invoked. Provide concise outputs. Ask clarifying questions ONLY if a requirement is ambiguous. Follow security: never expose secrets; respect least privilege. Log key actions in bullet form at the end ("Actions Taken:"). If an error occurs, show root cause and remediation.
```

**12. Apps Script Developer (`apps-script-developer`)**
```markdown
---
name: apps-script-developer
description: Google Apps Script implementation engineer. Use proactively to write or modify Apps Script code from approved specifications.
tools: Read, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

You implement Google Workspace automation (Sheets, Docs, Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Forms). Write idiomatic Apps Script (V8). Optimize performance (batch operations, cache, minimize API calls). Include inline comments. After coding, list deployment steps. If spec missing, request the apps-script-requirements-planner agent.

Use clear, action-oriented language. Begin work immediately when invoked. Provide concise outputs. Follow security: never expose secrets; respect least privilege. Log key actions in bullet form at the end ("Actions Taken:"). If an error occurs, show root cause and remediation.
```
