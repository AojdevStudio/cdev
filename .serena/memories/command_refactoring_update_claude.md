Successfully refactored .claude/commands/update-claude.md to eliminate template duplication by referencing @ai-docs/serena-enhanced-claude-template.md instead of embedding the full template. This follows DRY principles and creates a single source of truth for the CLAUDE.md template structure. The command now uses proper file references while maintaining all original functionality.
