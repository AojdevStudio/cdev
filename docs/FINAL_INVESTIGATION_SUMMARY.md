# Final Investigation Summary: NPX vs CLI Mystery Solved

## Root Cause Identified

The `cdev` command is **not a globally installed package** but rather a **shell alias** that runs:

```bash
alias cdev="npx @aojdevstudio/cdev@latest install"
```

## Key Discovery

```bash
$ which cdev
cdev: aliased to npx @aojdevstudio/cdev@latest install
```

This explains why:

- `npx @aojdevstudio/cdev@latest install` works → It's the actual command
- `cdev install` appears to work → The alias includes "install"
- Global installation fails → There is no global installation

## The Complete Picture

1. **No Global Installation**: The package is NOT installed globally via `npm install -g`
2. **Shell Alias**: Someone created an alias `cdev` that runs the npx command
3. **Misleading Error**: When running just `cdev` without arguments, it tries to run `npx @aojdevstudio/cdev@latest install install` (double install)
4. **Package Structure**: The package itself is correctly structured with all required directories

## Solution

To properly support both NPX and global CLI usage:

### Option 1: Remove the Alias and Install Globally

```bash
# Remove the alias
unalias cdev

# Install globally
npm install -g @aojdevstudio/cdev@latest

# Now use normally
cdev install
cdev status
cdev --help
```

### Option 2: Update Documentation

Clarify that the tool should be used via NPX:

```bash
# For one-time installation
npx @aojdevstudio/cdev@latest install

# Or install globally for regular use
npm install -g @aojdevstudio/cdev
cdev install
```

### Option 3: Keep the Alias but Fix It

Create proper aliases for all commands:

```bash
alias cdev="npx @aojdevstudio/cdev@latest"
# Now all commands work: cdev install, cdev status, etc.
```

## Verification Steps Performed

1. ✅ Checked package.json bin configuration → Correct
2. ✅ Verified package contents via npm pack → All directories included
3. ✅ Analyzed InteractiveInstaller code → No issues
4. ✅ Checked global npm installation → Not installed
5. ✅ Discovered shell alias → Root cause found

## Conclusion

There is **no bug** in the cdev package. The confusion arose from a shell alias that made it appear as if there was a global installation when there wasn't. The package works correctly when:

- Used via NPX: `npx @aojdevstudio/cdev@latest [command]`
- Properly installed globally: `npm install -g @aojdevstudio/cdev`

The investigation revealed that the package structure is complete and the installer works as designed.
