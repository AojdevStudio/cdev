**Status: ACTIVE** ‚úÖ

**Duration:** 3 months

**Key Activities:**
- ‚úÖ All scripts converted to Python
- ‚úÖ Old scripts archived to `scripts/archived/`
- ‚úÖ Wrapper scripts created for backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Migration guide published

**User Impact:** Minimal - all existing workflows continue to function

**What Users Should Do:**
- Start testing Python scripts in development environments
- Update local scripts and aliases
- Review the migration guide
- Report any issues or missing features

### Phase 2: Active Deprecation (October 2025 - January 2026)

**Status: PLANNED** üü°

**Duration:** 3 months

**Key Activities:**
- Add prominent deprecation warnings to wrapper scripts
- Include migration hints in warning messages
- Track wrapper usage metrics (optional)
- Send reminder notifications
- Update documentation with removal date

**User Impact:** Warning messages on every script execution

**Warning Message Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  DEPRECATION WARNING: This script will be REMOVED on January 12, 2026
   
   Old: ./scripts/deploy.sh
   New: python scripts/python/deploy.py
   
   Please update your workflows NOW to avoid disruption.
   See: docs/migration-announcement.md for details.
```

**What Users Should Do:**
- Complete migration to Python scripts
- Update all automated workflows
- Update documentation and runbooks
- Ensure team members are aware of changes

### Phase 3: Final Removal (January 2026)

**Status: PLANNED** üî¥

**Date:** January 12, 2026

**Key Activities:**
- Remove all wrapper scripts
- Remove archived shell/JS scripts (optional)
- Update all documentation
- Final announcement
- Close migration-related issues

**User Impact:** Old script paths will no longer work

**What Happens:**
```bash
# This will no longer work
./scripts/deploy.sh
# Error: scripts/deploy.sh: No such file or directory

# Only this will work
python scripts/python/deploy.py
```
