# Script Migration Announcement

**Date: July 12, 2025**

## Important: Shell and JavaScript Scripts Migration to Python

We are pleased to announce the completion of our script modernization initiative. All shell and JavaScript scripts have been successfully rewritten in Python, providing improved cross-platform compatibility, better error handling, and enhanced maintainability.

## What's Changing

### Scripts Being Migrated

All scripts in the `scripts/` directory have been converted:

**Shell Scripts:**
- agent-commit-enhanced.sh → agent-commit.py
- cache-linear-issue.sh → cache-linear-issue.py
- deploy.sh → deploy.py
- integrate-parallel-work.sh → integrate-parallel-work.py
- monitor-agents.sh → monitor-agents.py
- resolve-conflicts.sh → resolve-conflicts.py
- spawn-agents.sh → spawn-agents.py
- test-locally.sh → test-locally.py
- validate-parallel-work.sh → validate-parallel-work.py

**JavaScript Scripts:**
- decompose-parallel.cjs → decompose-parallel.py
- intelligent-agent-generator.js → intelligent-agent-generator.py
- postpublish.js → postpublish.py
- prepublish.js → prepublish.py
- security-check.js → security-check.py

## Benefits of Python Scripts

### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No more shell script compatibility issues
- Consistent behavior across all environments

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Proper exception handling with stack traces
- Better debugging capabilities

### 3. Improved Features
- Built-in help documentation (`--help` flag)
- Better argument parsing and validation
- Enhanced logging and progress indicators
- Improved performance through optimizations

### 4. Better Maintainability
- Single language reduces complexity
- Type hints improve code quality
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Easier to contribute and review

## Migration Guide

### For Direct Script Usage

```bash
# Old way
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment production

# New way
python scripts/python/deploy.py --environment production
```

### For npm Scripts

Update your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // Old
    "deploy": "./scripts/deploy.sh",
    "prepublishOnly": "node scripts/prepublish.js",
    
    // New
    "deploy": "python scripts/python/deploy.py",
    "prepublishOnly": "python scripts/python/prepublish.py"
  }
}
```

### For CI/CD Pipelines

Update your workflow files:

```yaml
# Old
- name: Run deployment
  run: ./scripts/deploy.sh

# New
- name: Run deployment
  run: python scripts/python/deploy.py
```

### For Custom Integrations

If you have custom scripts that call our scripts:

```bash
# Old
#!/bin/bash
./scripts/spawn-agents.sh "$@"

# New
#!/bin/bash
python scripts/python/spawn-agents.py "$@"
```

## Backward Compatibility

To ensure a smooth transition, we've implemented:

1. **Wrapper Scripts**: Located in `scripts/wrappers/`, these maintain the old interface while calling the new Python scripts
2. **Deprecation Notices**: Clear warnings when using old script paths
3. **Grace Period**: 6 months before complete removal of wrappers

## Timeline

| Date | Phase | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| **July 2025** | Migration Complete | Python scripts available, wrappers active |
| **October 2025** | Deprecation Warnings | Enhanced warnings in wrapper scripts |
| **January 2026** | Wrapper Removal | Old script interfaces removed |

## Getting Help

### Documentation
- Python script documentation: `scripts/python/README.md`
- Individual script help: `python scripts/python/[script-name].py --help`
- Migration FAQ: See below

### Support
- Open an issue for migration problems
- Check existing issues for common problems
- Review the wrapper scripts for compatibility details

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to install Python?
**A:** Python 3.8 or higher is required. Most systems have Python pre-installed. Check with `python --version` or `python3 --version`.

### Q: Will my existing workflows break?
**A:** No. Wrapper scripts ensure backward compatibility during the transition period.

### Q: Are all features preserved?
**A:** Yes, all features are preserved and many scripts have enhanced functionality.

### Q: What about Windows users?
**A:** Python scripts provide better Windows support than shell scripts ever could.

### Q: Can I still use the old scripts?
**A:** Yes, through wrappers until January 2026. We strongly recommend migrating sooner.

### Q: Are the command-line arguments the same?
**A:** Yes, all arguments are preserved. Python scripts often support additional options.

## Action Items

1. **Test the Python scripts** in your development environment
2. **Update your workflows** to use Python scripts directly
3. **Update documentation** to reference the new script locations
4. **Report any issues** during migration

## Conclusion

This migration represents a significant improvement in our tooling infrastructure. The move to Python provides a more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly scripting environment.

We appreciate your patience during this transition and encourage you to start using the Python scripts immediately to benefit from their improvements.

Thank you for your continued support!
