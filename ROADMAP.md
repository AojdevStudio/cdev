## Key Decisions

- **Architecture:** Hybrid JavaScript/Python for maximum compatibility, not pure JS
- **Distribution:** NPM global package, not desktop app or VS Code extension
- **Pricing Model:** Usage-based with generous free tier, not flat subscription
- **Hook System:** File-based in .claude/hooks/, not database or API-based
- **Scope:** Focus on Claude Code integration only, not general AI tool support

## Review Schedule

- August 20, 2025: v0.1.0 progress review
- September 15, 2025: Demo mode launch review
- October 15, 2025: First customer onboarding review
- November 30, 2025: v1.0.0 readiness assessment
- January 15, 2026: Platform architecture review

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Hook execution failures across package managers**
  - Mitigation: Extensive testing matrix, fallback mechanisms
- **MCP agent communication complexity**
  - Mitigation: Start with simple status reporting, iterate based on usage

### Business Risks
- **Low adoption rate**
  - Mitigation: 30-second demo mode, extensive documentation, community outreach
- **Payment processing issues**
  - Mitigation: Use proven Stripe integration, implement retry logic

### Resource Risks
- **Limited development capacity**
  - Mitigation: Focus on core features, defer nice-to-haves, encourage community contributions
