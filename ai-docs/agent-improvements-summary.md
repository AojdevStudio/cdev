# CDEV Agent System - Recent Improvements Summary

## Overview

The CDEV agent system has undergone significant improvements to enhance productivity, reduce tool overhead, and provide more structured workflows. This document summarizes the key improvements made to each agent and their current capabilities.

## Recent Optimization Principles

### Tool Rationalization

- **Before**: Some agents had 26+ tools causing confusion and performance issues
- **After**: Streamlined to 3-9 essential tools per agent based on specific role requirements
- **Result**: Faster agent invocation, clearer purpose, better performance

### Structured Workflows

- **Before**: Open-ended instructions leading to inconsistent execution
- **After**: 6-7 step numbered workflows with clear checkpoints
- **Result**: Predictable, repeatable agent behavior with quality gates

### Modern Tool Integration

- **Context7 MCP**: Library documentation and API verification for development agents
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time diagnostics, code execution, and test running
- **Linear Integration**: Ticket management and project tracking capabilities
