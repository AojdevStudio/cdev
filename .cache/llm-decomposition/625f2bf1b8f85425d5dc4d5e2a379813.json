    "parallelizationStrategy": "Each agent operates in complete isolation within their functional domain. The CLI agent focuses on user interaction, the installer agent handles file copying and setup, the validator agent checks environment prerequisites, the config agent manages user configuration, and the package agent handles metadata and distribution. Agents interact only through well-defined interfaces (e.g., function calls or data contracts) rather than shared file modifications. This structure allows all agents to work simultaneously without waiting for each other, maximizing parallel development.",
    "reasoning": "The decomposition is designed to adhere to the critical requirements of exclusive file ownership and simultaneous work. By splitting the project into distinct functional domains (CLI, installation, validation, configuration, and packaging), each agent owns a complete set of files without overlap. Shared resources like package.json are assigned to a single agent (package_agent) to prevent conflicts. Dependencies are minimized by focusing on independent development of each domain, with interactions limited to runtime function calls rather than build-time code dependencies. This approach avoids sequential chains and ensures that agents can work in parallel using Git worktrees or separate branches without file conflicts. The estimated times reflect the relative complexity of each domain, with installation logic being the most intensive due to template management."
