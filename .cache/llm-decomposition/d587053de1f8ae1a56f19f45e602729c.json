    "parallelizationStrategy": "Each agent works independently on their assigned files and tasks. They communicate through well-defined interfaces such as command-line arguments and configuration files. For example, the installer_agent relies on the output of the validator_agent to proceed with the installation only if the environment is validated successfully. Similarly, the configurator_agent uses the configuration data collected by the installer_agent to set up the project.",
    "reasoning": "By assigning each file to exactly one agent and ensuring that no agent modifies files owned by another, we eliminate the risk of file conflicts during parallel development. The use of interfaces for communication between agents minimizes dependencies and allows for independent testing and deployment of each component. This approach aligns with the critical requirements for parallel execution and ensures a robust, maintainable, and scalable development workflow."
