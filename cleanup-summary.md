# Cleanup Summary - CDEV Project

## Completed Actions

### 1. Removed Temporary Files

Moved to /tmp/cleanup-backup/:

- `test-agent-start.js` - Temporary test script
- `test-report.md` - Temporary test report
- `full-test-output.log` - Test execution log
- `test-output.log` - Test execution log
- `aojdevstudio-cdev-1.0.0.tgz` - Package archive

These files were already in .gitignore, so no git changes needed.

## Pending Actions Requiring Review

### 1. Duplicate Test Files

Found 12 duplicate test files between `src/` and `test/` directories:

- The files in `test/` appear to be newer (updated July 14 16:05)
- The files in `src/` are older but have more lines of code

**Recommendation**: Review test coverage before removing duplicates. The `test/` directory versions may be refactored/optimized versions.

### 2. Jest Configuration Files

The multiple Jest configs are **intentionally separate** for:

- `jest.config.unit.js` - Unit tests only
- `jest.config.integration.js` - Integration tests
- `jest.config.dom.js` - DOM-specific tests
- `jest.config.coverage.js` - Coverage reporting
- `jest.config.js` - Main/default configuration

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is. This separation allows faster test runs for specific test types.

### 3. Potentially Unused Dependencies

Review these dependencies in package.json:

- `commander` - May be used in CLI but not found in direct requires
- `semver` - Not found in source files
- `which` - Not found in source files
- `ts-jest` - Project uses JavaScript, not TypeScript
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - No React components found

**Recommendation**: Run `npm run test:all` first to ensure nothing breaks before removing.

### 4. Package.json Scripts Cleanup

Scripts contain hardcoded paths: `/Users/ossieirondi/.local/bin`
**Recommendation**: Use relative paths or environment variables instead.

## Safe Cleanup Commands

```bash
# Already completed - temporary files moved to backup

# To remove duplicate tests (after verification):
# rm src/*.test.js

# To check unused dependencies:
# npm ls commander semver which ts-jest @testing-library/jest-dom

# To find truly unused dependencies:
# npx depcheck
```

## Next Steps

1. Run full test suite to ensure nothing is broken
2. Review test files to decide which versions to keep
3. Use `npx depcheck` to identify truly unused dependencies
4. Consider updating hardcoded paths in package.json scripts
