    "reasoning": "The decomposition ensures that each agent has exclusive ownership of their files, allowing for maximum parallelization. The agents are organized around distinct functional domains, minimizing dependencies and enabling independent development. The package_agent handles all package-related files, while other agents focus on their specific areas without the need for shared files. This approach ensures that agents can work simultaneously without conflicts, adhering to the critical requirements for parallel execution.",
    "parallelizationStrategy": "Each agent owns a complete functional domain with no shared files. Agents can work simultaneously without waiting for each other. Communication between agents is handled through well-defined interfaces and data contracts rather than shared code. The package_agent manages the package.json and dependencies, while other agents focus on their specific domains without modifying shared files."
