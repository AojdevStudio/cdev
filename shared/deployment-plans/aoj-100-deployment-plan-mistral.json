    "reasoning": "The decomposition is based on the principle of separating concerns and maximizing parallel development. Each agent is assigned a specific functional domain and owns all files related to that domain. This ensures that no two agents need to modify the same file, allowing for true parallel development. The agents are designed to be as independent as possible, with minimal dependencies between them. This approach ensures that agents can work simultaneously without waiting for each other, maximizing the potential for parallel execution.",
    "parallelizationStrategy": "Each agent is responsible for a distinct functional domain and owns all files related to that domain. Agents work in parallel by focusing on their own files and domains without the need for inter-agent coordination. Inter-agent communication is handled through well-defined interfaces and data contracts, ensuring minimal dependencies and maximum parallelization."
