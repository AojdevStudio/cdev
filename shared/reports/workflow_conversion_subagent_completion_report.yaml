validation_results:
  uv_shebang: ✅ All scripts use correct UV shebang
  pep_723_metadata: ✅ All scripts include inline metadata
  yaml_output: ✅ All scripts use yaml.dump() for YAML output
  click_cli: ✅ All scripts use Click for argument handling
  executable: ✅ All scripts have executable permissions
  functionality: ✅ All Git operations preserved from bash scripts
  error_handling: ✅ All scripts handle errors with proper exit codes

notes: |
  All workflow conversion tasks were completed prior to this agent's execution.
  The converted Python scripts are fully functional and ready for use.
  Each script maintains feature parity with its bash counterpart while adding
  improved error handling, better output formatting with Rich library, and
  structured YAML output instead of JSON.

recommendation: |
  No further action required. All scripts have been successfully converted
  and are ready for production use.
