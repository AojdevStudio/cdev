### 2. Documentation Reorganization

Moved documentation files from root directory to organized locations:

### 3. Test File Consolidation

Organized scattered test files into unified test directory structure:

- `infrastructure/*.test.ts` → `test/infrastructure/`
- `operations/*.test.ts` → `test/operations/`
- `integration/*.test.ts` → `test/integration/`
