# Remaining Tasks Summary

## Active Agent Contexts

### 1. workflow_scripts_agent.json
**Status**: Incomplete  
**Focus**: Convert Workflow Scripts to Python  
**Missing Files**:
- `scripts/python/validate-parallel-work.py`
- `scripts/python/integrate-parallel-work.py`
- `scripts/python/resolve-conflicts.py`

### 2. validation_subagent.json  
**Status**: Partially Complete  
**Focus**: Validation Tasks  
**Completed**: Agent 5 tasks (prepublish.py, postpublish.py, security-check.py) ✓  
**Incomplete**: Agent 3 tasks (same as workflow_scripts_agent above)

## Summary
Both remaining agent contexts are waiting for the same 3 workflow scripts to be converted:
1. validate-parallel-work.sh → validate-parallel-work.py
2. integrate-parallel-work.sh → integrate-parallel-work.py  
3. resolve-conflicts.sh → resolve-conflicts.py

These scripts handle git operations and conflict resolution, which are critical for the parallel development workflow.
