    "here's some feedback i got about our commit-2.0.md command - could you explore it with serena and give me suggestions on how we can improve it.   Lessons Learned\n\n  The git-flow-manager subagents handled the complexity well, but the pre-commit hooks essentially forced a\n  more sequential approach than the \"parallel\" strategy promised. In hindsight, for a codebase with aggressive\n  formatting hooks, a single coordinated commit might be more predictable than trying to split into perfectly\n  isolated atomic commits.\n\n  The end result was still good - clean, conventional commits with proper organization - but the path there was\n   messier than the initial plan suggested!",
    "i agree that was smart of you. go ahead",
    "tech debt king did you just give me an extra set of commit commands lol.. look shouldn't the gitflow manager be able to handle the complexity? allowing us to just have 1 commit command to remember?",
    "ok i just deleted the commit-2.0.md now just get the commit.md command to actually be formatted in our @ai-docs/custom-command-template.md style"
