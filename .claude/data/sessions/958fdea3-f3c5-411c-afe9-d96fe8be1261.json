    "the agent needs access to the shad-cn ui mcp tools ",
    "now have meta-agent circle back and evaluate the tools, we know we want eyes and principles, soo playwright serves as our eyes, shadcn-ui serves as our principles, read allows us to see how the file is, now do we need the others, grep, glob, write, multiedit? ",
    "ok now meta agent i'm going to task you with something super important. I want to built the ultimate UI-designer. He will have access to the shadcn-ui MCP, and other relevant tools. I want them to be an S-tier designer. THink liquid glass (by apple look it up, here is a relavant link example https://21st.dev/uilayout.contact/liquid-weather-glass/default), think AirBnB design principles, https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/ .. i'm only sharing links on liquid glass because i want it to know exactly what i'm talking about when i request it.. it's not that i want that design type to be it's only thing. ultimately here is what its' principles should be https://www.shopify.com/blog/ui-design-principles and it should know that SHADCN is how it will accomplish this. ",
    "hi meta-agent. can you verify for me that this agent .claude/agents/liquid-glass-designer.md.claude/agents/liquid-glass-designer.md you just created is not just a one-trick pony for liquid glass aesthetics but is actually a proper ui-ux designer. giving it the name liquid-glass designer makes me think when it's asked to do something it will just give you liquid glass all the time. also it needs to follow the user's requests as well, for instance when given a small task to update the UI containers to liquid glass esthetics, and upgrade the conistency of the UI it started adding extra components that werent actually part of what was needed. If it thinks something should be added then it should report recommendations rather than deviating from the script and going rouge. ",
    "it should have eyes.. tell that to meta-agent, it should consider giving .claude/agents/interface-designer.md eyes and by that i mean these tools mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot, mcp__playwright__browser_resize, mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate",
    "i still like the old config so i kept that as well cause it's unique. can you compare the two and make recommendations to me not any changes .. i kinda want th old config to be a senior frontend person that can step in if the interface designer can't get something right. so look at .claude/agents/senior-frontend-designer.md and .claude/agents/interface-designer.md .. i don't want overlap..mmake suggestions not changes"
