    "the point is not fully captured. your structure template reads like a changelog. that's not the intent. we might already have docs in our docs folder that need one or two line updates, a function changed, a framework changed, we need to update an API endpoint, so that developers are kept up to speed, we might change something architectural. and then we need to create a doc, but likely we will be updating existing documentation with this command. so it would have to intake what is existing. it should be using our docs-curator subagent.
