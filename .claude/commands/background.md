# Background Claude Code

Run a Claude Code instance in the background to perform tasks autonomously while you continue working.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1  
MODEL: $2 (defaults to 'sonnet' if not provided)  
REPORT_FILE: $3 (defaults to './agents/background/background-report-DAY-NAME_HH_MM_SS.md' if not provided)

## Instructions

- Capture timestamp in a variable FIRST to ensure consistency across file creation and references  
- Create the initial report file with header BEFORE launching the background agent  
- Fire off a new Claude Code instance using the Bash tool with run_in_background=true  
- IMPORTANT: Pass the `USER_PROMPT` exactly as provided with no modifications  
- Set the model to either 'sonnet' or 'opus' based on `MODEL` parameter  
- Configure Claude Code with all necessary flags for automated operation  
- All report format instructions are embedded in the --append-system-prompt  
- Use --print flag to run in non-interactive mode  
- Use --output-format text for standard text output  
- Use --dangerously-skip-permissions to bypass permission prompts for automated operation  
- Use all provided cli flags AS IS. Do not alter them.  
- The append-system-prompt contains all report structure requirements and renaming logic  
- IMPORTANT: Do not alter the append-system-prompt in anyway.  

## Workflow

1. Create the report directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p agents/background
   ```
2. Set default values for parameters:
   - MODEL
   - TIMESTAMP (capture once for consistency)
   - REPORT_FILE (using the captured timestamp)

3. Create the initial report file with just the header (IMPORTANT: Only IF no report file is provided – if it is provided, echo it and skip this step):
   Get this into your context window so you know what to pass into the Claude Code command.
   ```bash
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%a_%H_%M_%S)
    echo "TIMESTAMP: ${TIMESTAMP}"
    REPORT_FILE="${REPORT_FILE:-./agents/background/background-report-${TIMESTAMP}.md}"
    echo "REPORT_FILE: ${REPORT_FILE}"
    echo "# Background Agent Report – ${TIMESTAMP}" > "${REPORT_FILE}"
    ```
<primary-agent-delegation>  
4. Construct the Claude Code command with all settings:

    - Execute the command using Bash with run_in_background=true
    ```bash
    claude \ 
        --model "${MODEL}" \
        --output-format text \
        --dangerously-skip-permissions \
        --append-system-prompt "IMPORTANT: You are running as a background agent. Your primary resposibilties are to execute work and document your progress continuously in ${REPORT_FILE}. Iteratively write to the report file continuously as you work. Every few tool calls you should update the REPORT_FILE ## Progress section. Follow this file structure.

##  WORKFLOW

IMPORTANT: You MUST follow this workflow as you work:

1. The file ${REPORT_FILE} has been created with a header. You must UPDATE as you proceed it (not recreate it) with this EXACT markdown structure:

```markdown
# Background Agent Report – DAY-NAME_HH_MM_SS

## Task Understanding
Clearly state what the user requested. Break down complex requests into numbered items:  
User requested:  
1. [First task item]  
2. [Second task item]  
3. [Next task item]  

## Progress
IMPORTANT: Document each major step as you work. Update this section as you work:  
- Starting task execution  
- [Action taken with tool/command used]  
- [Finding or observation]  
- [Next action]  
(Keep adding bullets as you work)

## Results
List concrete outcomes and deliverables with specific details. Update as you work:  
- [Specific file created/modified with path]  
- [Numeric data or metrics]  
- [Actual accomplishments]  

## Task Completed (or Task Failed)
[Final summary – success confirmation or failure explanation]

ADDITIONAL SECTIONS (add as needed):
- ## Blockers - Issues preventing progress
- ## Decisions made - Important choices and rationale
- ## Recomendations - Follow-up suggestions 
```
    ```
5. Execute the command using Bash with run_in_background=true
